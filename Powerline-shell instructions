Step 1: Install pip for python3
sudo apt install python3-pip //make sure it's python3!

Step 2: Install git or make sure you have git installed
sudo apt install git


Step 3: Next you can install Powerline with the help of pip command as shown.

sudo pip3 install git+git://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline //make sure you write pip3 for the third version of python!

Step 4: Powerline uses special glyphs to show special arrow effect and symbols for developers. For this, you must have a symbol font or a patched font installed on your systems.
wget https://github.com/powerline/powerline/raw/develop/font/PowerlineSymbols.otf
wget https://github.com/powerline/powerline/raw/develop/font/10-powerline-symbols.conf

Step 5: Then you need to move the font to your fonts directory
sudo mv PowerlineSymbols.otf /usr/share/fonts/
sudo mv 10-powerline-symbols.conf /etc/fonts/conf.d/

Step 6:
pip3 show powerline-status //get the location of installed powerline using following command, pip3!
(/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages)

step 7: Copy-paste these commands in .bashrc

#export TERM=”screen-256color” //In some cases it causes problems, it also works fine withouth this line
powerline-daemon -q
POWERLINE_BASH_CONTINUATION=1
POWERLINE_BASH_SELECT=1
. /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/powerline/bindings/bash/powerline.sh //make sure to replace the location in the line as per your system suggested.
